1 a. Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.

      Solution:
 	  -> Recursion is the process in which a method calls itself to solve a problem
	  -> Used when some operation repeats itself multiple times


4 a. Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.

      Solution:
 	  The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n)

  b. Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
 
       Solution:
	  To optimize the recursive solution, we can use a mechanism called memoization (storing repetitive calculations)
